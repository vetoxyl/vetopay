# VetoPay Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview
The backend is responsible for all core services such as authentication, wallet management, transaction processing, and admin controls. Built with Node.js and Express.js, it ensures high security, scalability, and observability.

---

## Architecture
- **RESTful API** using Express.js
- **Layered pattern**: Controllers → Services → Repositories
- **Modular structure** with feature-specific domains

---

## Core Modules

### 1. Authentication
- Register/login with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- JWT token issuance and verification
- Middleware for protected routes

### 2. User Management
- CRUD operations for users
- Role assignment and enforcement
- Profile update endpoints

### 3. Wallet Service
- Auto-creation of wallets
- Real-time balance updates
- Currency support structure (USD by default)

### 4. Transaction Engine
- Create and process transactions (send/receive)
- Transaction lifecycle: pending → completed/failed
- Fraud check and admin overrides

### 5. Admin Panel API
- View all users, wallets, and transactions
- Suspend/reactivate user accounts
- Audit log exposure endpoints

### 6. Notifications
- Push messages via WebSocket or Pub/Sub (optional)
- Email hooks using AWS SES or SendGrid
